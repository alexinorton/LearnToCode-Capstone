üíª Interesting Code Snippet
Unit testing is a useful way to prove that your code works the way it‚Äôs supposed to. In this project I used a unit test to automatically check if parts of my program are doing their job correctly. This is a very powerful tool that can save alot of time fixing code that could've been handled with a unit test.

@Test
    public void testGetTotalPrice_withExtras() {
        Sandwich sandwich = new Sandwich("Wheat", 8, "Turkey", "Swiss");
        sandwich.setExtraMeat(true);
        sandwich.setExtraCheese(true);

        double expected = sandwich.calculateBasePrice() + sandwich.getExtraMeatPrice() + sandwich.getExtraCheesePrice();
        double actual = sandwich.getTotalPrice();

        assertEquals(expected, actual, 0.01);
    }
}
